# *MapReduce*

MapReduce is a programming model and implementation to enable the parallel processing of huge amounts of data. In a nutshell, it breaks a large dataset into smaller chunks to be processed separately on different worker nodes and automatically gathers the results across the multiple nodes to return a single result.
